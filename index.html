						<h2>Thinking Critically: Enterprise Software Defined</h2>
						<p><strong>A Thought-Provoking Question:</strong> How do you make sense of the idea that enterprise software is all about "organizational needs," when organizations are really made up of individual users with different tech skills and ways of working?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Another Question to Consider:</strong> What are the ethical considerations when enterprise software focuses more on how efficient a company is, rather than how good the user experience is or how happy employees are?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Taking a Closer Look: Balancing Different Needs</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>A Tough Question:</strong> If reliability means almost perfect uptime, how do you manage this alongside the need to release updates often and add new features quickly in a competitive market?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>A Tricky Situation:</strong> How can enterprise software truly grow and adapt when every new connection point could make things incredibly complicated?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>A Real Dilemma:</strong> At what point does security become so strict that it hurts productivity, and how can we measure this give-and-take?</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A Systems Thinking Question</h2>
						<ul>			
							<li><strong>Dealing with Complexity:</strong> How do you design systems that are easy to maintain when the business rules have been around for decades, involve many different people, and need to change with unpredictable new rules?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Integration Puzzle:</strong> If enterprise software needs to connect with older systems that don't have modern ways of communicating, how do you stop the simplest connection from making your whole system worse?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Adapting to New Rules:</strong> How should software designers plan for rules and regulations that don't even exist yet, especially with new tech like AI and the Internet of Things?</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>A Closer Look at the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h3>
						<img src="sdlc.png" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<p><strong>A Fundamental Question:</strong> Is the step-by-step way we show SDLC helpful, or does it dangerously oversimplify the messy reality of developing software?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Thinking About the SDLC</h3>
						<p><strong>A Core Question:</strong> If creating software is naturally a creative and unpredictable process, how can we justify using strict methods like SDLC?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>A Deeper Question:</strong> Are we using SDLC to truly make software better, or to just give the impression of control and predictability to people who don't understand how development really works?</p>	
					</section>	
					<section>
						<h2>Looking at Each Phase: Hidden Details</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Requirements Puzzle:</strong> How do you gather all the "complete" requirements for a system that will definitely change the very business processes it's supposed to help?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Analysis Pitfall:</strong> When does trying to understand everything become "analysis paralysis," and how do you find the right balance between thorough planning and needing to start building?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Evolving Design:</strong> If the system's overall structure needs to change during development, how do you keep initial design choices from becoming a burden later on?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Reality of Building:</strong> How do you keep code good and teams productive when requirements shift in the middle of development?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Testing Dilemma:</strong> Can you ever truly be sure that complex enterprise software "meets requirements" when those requirements are themselves just interpretations of what the business needs?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>The Deployment Hurdle:</strong> How do you handle the risk of releasing software that works perfectly in testing but fails when it's live because of unknown factors?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Maintenance Evolution:</strong> At what point does ongoing maintenance turn into a complete rewrite, and how do you plan for that transition?</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Comparing Models: What it Means for Strategy</h2>
						<p><strong>A Critical Look:</strong> Every SDLC model makes different assumptions about uncertainty, change, and risk. What are the core philosophical differences?</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Waterfall Thinking:</strong> Assumes you can know all requirements upfront and that changes are costly. But is this realistic in a fast-changing business world?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Agile's Contradiction:</strong> Claims to embrace change but needs a lot of discipline and a shift in company culture. How do you know if your "Agile" process is truly agile?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>Spiral's Focus on Risk:</strong> Puts a lot of emphasis on checking for risks at each step. But how do you spot risks you don't even know exist?</li>
							<li class="fragment"><strong>V-Model's Verification:</strong> Connects each development step with testing. But can testing keep up with changing requirements?</li>
						</ul>	
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="waterfall.png" style="width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<p><strong>A Key Question:</strong> If "each phase must be completed before moving to the next" is the main rule, how do you deal with the inevitable discovery that earlier steps were based on incorrect ideas?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="iterative.png" style="width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<p><strong>A Complex Thought:</strong> If development happens in small steps, how do you keep the overall structure of the system consistent and stop it from just becoming a bunch of unconnected features?</p>
					</section>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Thinking About Architecture: More Than Just Tech</h2>
						<p><strong>A Fundamental Question:</strong> Is software architecture mainly about technical decisions, or is it actually a way of designing how an organization works, just put into code?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>A Look at Design Patterns:</strong> Are design patterns true solutions to common problems, or are they more like temporary fixes that point to bigger issues in our programming languages and methods?</p>
					</section>
					</section>
						<section>
							<h3>Choosing Your Architectural Approach: It Depends on the Situation</h3>
							<p><strong>A Strategic Question:</strong> How do you decide between these different architectural styles when each one has huge impacts on team structure, how you release software, and how much it costs to maintain in the long run?</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Monolithic Choices:</strong> When does a simple, all-in-one system become too complicated?</li>
								<li><strong>Microservices Pondering:</strong> How do you stop microservices from creating more headaches than they solve?</li>
								<li><strong>Serverless Reality Check:</strong> Is "serverless" truly without servers, or is it just letting cloud providers handle the server management?</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
					<section>
						<img src="Monolithic architecture@2x.png" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<h3>A Deep Look at Monolithic Architecture</h3>
						<p><strong>A Critical Question:</strong> If monolithic architecture is "old-fashioned" and supposedly out of date, why do many successful companies still pick it for new projects? What are we missing in the microservices story?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>The Complexity Puzzle:</strong> How do you know when a monolith has become too complicated, and how do you tell if breaking it apart will actually make the whole system simpler or more complex?</p>
						</section>	
					<section>
						<img src="Microservice architecture@2x.png" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<h3>Thinking About Microservices</h3>
						<p><strong>A Fundamental Question:</strong> If microservices architecture splits applications into independent parts, how do you handle business processes that naturally need different services to work together?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Conway's Law:</strong> Since microservices often reflect how an organization is set up, are we designing software in the best way, or just making things convenient for management?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Philosophy Behind Design Patterns</h2>
						<p><strong>A Big Question:</strong> Do design patterns represent timeless wisdom in software engineering, or are they more like historical reminders of how specific programming languages and methods used to be?</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>The Singleton Debate:</strong> Is the Singleton pattern a useful tool, or is it just a hidden global variable that goes against good object-oriented design?</li>
							<li><strong>The Prototype Question:</strong> In languages where you can create objects dynamically, does the Prototype pattern really solve a problem, or does it just add unnecessary complexity?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img src="singleton-1.5x.png" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<p><strong>A Critical Point:</strong> If Singleton makes sure only one instance exists globally, how do you handle testing, multiple users at once, and connecting different parts of the code without breaking the pattern's main idea?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="prototype-1.5x.png" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
						<p><strong>A Deeper Question:</strong> When you copy existing objects to make new ones, how do you manage copying nested objects versus just references, and how do you keep everything consistently linked?</p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Version Control: More Than Just a Tech Tool</h2>
						<p><strong>A Philosophical Question:</strong> Is version control mainly a technical tool for managing code changes, or is it actually a system for keeping track of a company's decisions and history?</p>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>The Collaboration Puzzle:</strong> How do you balance the good things about working together with the fact that too many people contributing can lead to slow decision-making and inconsistent design?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>History vs. Moving Forward:</strong> When does being able to "go back to old versions" become something that stops teams from making bold new architectural choices?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Branching Strategies:</strong> How do you choose between different ways of organizing branches when each one implies different things about how your team works, how often you release, and how much risk you're willing to take?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Installing Git: Dealing with Different Setups</h2>
						<p><strong>A Systems Thinking Question:</strong> If installing and setting up Git is different on various computers, how do you make sure everyone on the team works in the same way, no matter their setup?</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Tool Reliance:</strong> How do you balance the ease of graphical tools with the power and flexibility of command-line tools?</li>
							<li><strong>Managing Settings:</strong> What are the security concerns of having global Git settings, especially in shared development environments?</li>
							<li><strong>Version Differences:</strong> How do you handle different Git versions among team members and where you deploy your code?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Who Made This Code?</h2>
						<p><strong>A Complex Question:</strong> Beyond just the technical need, what are the bigger philosophical and legal points about giving credit for code changes to specific people?</p>
						<pre><code class="hljs javascript" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							git config --global user.name "Your Name"
							git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
							</code></pre>
							<p class="fragment"><strong>Thinking About Ethics:</strong> How do you handle giving credit for code in team environments where ideas come from group discussions, not just one person?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>The Verification Puzzle:</strong> If checking your settings is crucial, how do you make sure the checking process itself doesn't cause errors or security weaknesses?</p>
						<pre><code class="hljs javascript" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							git config --list
							</code></pre>
							<p class="fragment"><strong>Managing Settings:</strong> How do you handle Git settings across many different projects with varying needs, team structures, and security rules?</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h2 data-id="code-title">Git Commands: How We Work</h2>
						<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs javascript" data-trim data-line-numbers="|4,8-11|17|22-24"><script type="text/template">
							git init
							git add .
							git commit -m "Initial commit"
							git push origin master
							git pull origin master
						</script></code></pre><br>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Looking at Our Workflow:</strong> Do these "most used" commands represent good practices, or do they reflect common shortcuts that might lead to less organized version control?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>A Critical Question:</strong> How do you find the right balance between the simplicity of basic Git workflows and the complexities of real-world teamwork in development?</p>

						<p><strong>A Strategic Question:</strong> How do you balance the ease of GitHub's all-in-one platform with the risks of being tied to one company and relying on a single commercial entity?</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>The Open Source Twist:</strong> Is it a bit odd that so much of the open-source world depends on a private platform owned by Microsoft?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>GitHub Benefits: A Closer Look</h2>
						<p><strong>Assessing Value:</strong> How do you measure the real value of GitHub's features beyond what their marketing says?</p>

						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>GitHub CLI: Thinking About Command Line Tools</h2>
					<p><strong>An Interface Design Question:</strong> Does GitHub CLI truly make you more productive, or is it just another layer that hides what's really happening with Git?</p>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>Looking at Dependencies:</strong> How do you balance the efficiency of command-line tools with the risk of creating development processes that rely on specific companies?</p>	
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Installation Dependencies: The Messy Dev Environment</h2>
					<p><strong>A Systems Question:</strong> How do you handle the increasing complexity of all the different development tools and their connections across various team members and deployment setups?</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Too Many Tools:</strong> At what point does adding more development tools actually make you less productive instead of more?</li>
						<li><strong>Reliable Installation:</strong> How do you make sure tools behave consistently across different operating systems and settings?</li>
						<li><strong>Authentication Security:</strong> What are the security concerns when command-line tools manage your logins across many different services?</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Authentication: Balancing Security and Convenience</h2>
					<p><strong>A Security Trade-off Question:</strong> How do you balance the ease of automatic logins with the security risks of storing passwords and tokens?</p>
					<pre><code class="hljs javascript" data-trim data-line-numbers>

						<p class="fragment"><strong>Trust Boundaries:</strong> When you log in with GitHub CLI, how much access are you actually giving, and how do you check and limit this access?</p>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h2 data-id="code-title">CLI Commands: Layers of Abstraction</h2>
					
					<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs javascript" data-trim data-line-numbers="|4,8-11|17|22-24"><script type="text/template">
						gh auth login: How does this differ from Git's own login process?

							gh repo create <name>: What specific GitHub assumptions does this command make?

								gh issue create <title>: How does this fit into your existing project management?

									gh pr create: What review and approval steps does this skip or enforce?

											gh pr checkout <number>: How does this affect your local Git working area and branches?

												gh pr merge: What are the consequences of making merge decisions directly from the command line?
					</script></code></pre>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>A Big Question:</strong> Are these commands genuinely making development faster, or are they creating workflows unique to GitHub that make your code less flexible for other platforms?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open Source: Ideals vs. Reality</h2>
					<p><strong>A Philosophical Question:</strong> Is open source mainly a technical way of doing things, an economic approach, or a movement based on certain beliefs, and how do these different ideas sometimes clash?</p>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>The Sustainability Question:</strong> How do you reconcile the hopeful idea that "anyone can contribute" with the reality that most open-source projects need a lot of coordination, good documentation, and ongoing maintenance?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Contributing to Open Source: Why Do People Do It?</h2>
						<p><strong>A Critical Question:</strong> Beyond getting a "cool badge," what are the real reasons people contribute to open source and what stops them, and how do these vary for different groups of people?</p>
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">
						<img src="all-in-africa-open-source-contributor.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
					</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Assessing the Benefits:</strong> How do you measure the actual advantages of contributing to open source compared to the time and opportunities you might miss out on?</p>
